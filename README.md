# 🏥 Snowflake Eyecare Analytics Platform

A comprehensive, production-ready Snowflake data platform for eyecare practice analytics, supporting multi-tenant architecture and advanced AI-powered insights.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform provides:
- **Multi-Tenant Data Architecture** - Secure client data isolation
- **Real-Time Analytics** - KPIs, dashboards, and reporting
- **AI-Powered Insights** - Snowflake Cortex integration
- **Automated Data Pipelines** - ETL/ELT processing
- **Scalable Infrastructure** - 1-1000+ locations supported

## 📊 Architecture

```
Raw Data Sources → Snowflake (RAW → STAGING → MARTS) → Analytics Layer → Dashboards/APIs
```

### Data Flow:
1. **Ingestion** - Raw data from practice management systems
2. **Processing** - ETL/ELT transformations and data quality
3. **Modeling** - Dimensional models and business logic
4. **Analytics** - KPIs, dashboards, and AI insights
5. **Consumption** - Streamlit apps, APIs, reports
